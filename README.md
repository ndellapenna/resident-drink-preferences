## Drink Preferences of Surrounding Residents

This program can be used to analyze consumer data based on location 
as it implements basic object-oriented programming. By creating a program 
featuring this "resident" class, we can use the distance formula to sweep 
a desired radius in search of neighborhood preferences. This may prove 
to be useful for buisnesses that are supported by the residents of their 
respective neighborhoods.
